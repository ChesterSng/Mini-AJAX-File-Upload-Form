Mini-AJAX-File-Upload-Form
==========================

Modification for "Mini AJAX File Upload Form". This JQuery script allow visitors upload files from their browsers with drag/drop or by selecting them individually.

A brief usage tutorial can be found here: http://tutorialzine.com/2013/05/mini-ajax-file-upload-form/

The script is great, fancy and easy to use. However, due to it's simplicity, it doesn't give much options and feedback on the upload. Especially when uploading 100+ files you will entered a dilemma without knowing which file have been successfully uploaded. Therefore this modification has been made.
